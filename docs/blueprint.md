## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a vibrant teal (#008080) to capture professionalism and modern aesthetic appeal
- Background color: A desaturated, very light-teal background (#F0FFFF) will provide a clean and modern look while keeping the focus on the services and content.
- Accent color: Use a lively, eye-catching green (#00FF7F) to highlight CTAs, available time slots, or important information.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) provides a modern, neutral, and highly readable style, which also pairs excellently with other fonts if necessary.
- Use simple, professional icons for services and booking options. These icons should align with the minimalist design style. Avoid overwhelming use of icons.
- Design a grid-based layout with clear sections for service offerings, booking options, and project portfolios, promoting ease of navigation.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations for page elements, such as a gentle fade-in or slide-in effect, creating a fluid browsing experience.
